Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's.  The expert reads at an average pace of approximately 150 words per minute. The student's average reading speed is about 75 words per minute, which is half the speed of the expert. 

Notable deviations include:

* **Frequent pauses and hesitations:** The student pauses frequently throughout the reading, often struggling to pronounce words correctly.  This significantly impacts the reading fluency. 
* **Slowed pronunciation:** The student often pronounces words slowly and carefully, taking extra time to sound out syllables. While this might be a strategy to ensure accuracy, it hampers the overall reading speed.
* **Emphasis on certain words:** The student tends to emphasize certain words in the text, often slowing down the reading pace for those specific words. 

The student demonstrates a clear need for practice in improving reading fluency. Focused practice on word recognition and pronunciation would be beneficial in helping the student achieve a more natural and efficient reading speed.
