## Intonation Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

**Detailed list of intonation deviations:**

The student's performance demonstrates significant deviations from the expert's intonation pattern. The student often employs a flat intonation, lacking clear rising and falling tones, particularly when reading sentences.  

**Examples:**

* **0:00 - 0:08:** "Our environment is the surrounding where we live in."  The student reads this sentence with a flat tone, lacking the natural rise and fall of the expert's intonation.
* **0:08 - 0:16:**  "There are many ways in which we can ensure that the environment remains clean." The student's intonation is mostly flat, with only a slight rise at the end of the sentence.
* **0:16 - 0:23:** "Like throwing the garbage in the dustbin instead of littering the streets." The student uses a flat tone throughout, lacking the distinct rise and fall that the expert uses to emphasize different parts of the sentence.
* **0:23 - 0:31:** "We should avoid using plastic bags because it pollutes the environment as it cannot be recycled easily." The student reads this sentence with a flat tone, failing to convey the intended emphasis on key words like 'should', 'avoid', and 'easily'.

**Measurements:**

While exact measurements for intonation are not readily available, the student's consistent flat tone and lack of noticeable rising and falling patterns across most sentences indicate a significant deviation from the expert's more dynamic and natural intonation. 

**Overall:**

The student's performance suggests a need for further development in intonation. Focusing on practicing rising and falling tones in sentences, with emphasis on key words and phrases, would help improve the student's intonation and fluency.

# Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly lower than the expert's. The expert reads at a pace of approximately 150 words per minute, while the student reads at a pace of approximately 75 words per minute. This difference in reading speed is substantial and suggests that the student is struggling to maintain a pace that is conducive to comprehension. Additionally, the student's reading is characterized by frequent pauses and hesitations, which further hinders fluency and comprehension.  

The student's reading speed is almost half that of the expert, highlighting a significant need for improvement in this area.  The student's frequent pauses and hesitations suggest a lack of automaticity in word recognition. Focused practice on improving reading fluency, through techniques like repeated readings and choral reading, could greatly benefit the student.
