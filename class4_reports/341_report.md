## Intonation Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's intonation deviates significantly from the expert's throughout the recording.  While there are some instances of clear rising and falling tones, these are infrequent, falling well below the 50% threshold for the 'Transitional' category. 

**Specific examples of deviations:**

* **00:02-00:03**: "surroundings where we live in" - The student uses a flat tone throughout this phrase, lacking the rising and falling tones used by the expert to emphasize "surroundings" and "live".
* **00:06-00:08**: "It is essential to maintain cleanliness" - The student does not properly pronounce the 'essential' with a rising tone followed by a falling tone, instead maintaining a flat intonation.
* **00:11-00:13**: "by keeping our surroundings clean" - The student uses a flat tone for 'surroundings clean', whereas the expert utilizes a rising tone on 'surroundings' and a falling tone on 'clean'.
* **00:14-00:16**: "There are many ways in which we can ensure..." - The student lacks the clear rising tone on 'ways' and the falling tone on 'ensure' used by the expert.
* **00:17-00:19**: "...that the environment remains clean" - The student struggles to properly convey the rising and falling tones on 'environment' and 'clean', resulting in a flat intonation.
* **00:20-00:22**: "like throwing the garbage in the dustbin..." - The student's intonation is flat across 'like throwing the garbage', whereas the expert utilizes rising and falling tones for emphasis.
* **00:23-00:25**: "...instead of littering the streets" - The student uses a flat tone throughout this phrase, deviating from the rising tone on 'littering' and the falling tone on 'streets' used by the expert.
* **00:26-00:28**: "We should avoid using plastic bags..." - The student does not utilize the rising tone on 'avoid' and the falling tone on 'bags' present in the expert's rendition.
* **00:29-00:31**: "...because it pollutes the environment" - The student lacks the rising and falling tones on 'pollutes' and 'environment' that are key for clear communication.
* **00:32-00:34**: "...as it cannot be recycled easily" - The student's intonation remains flat, unlike the expert's rising tone on 'cannot' and falling tone on 'easily'.
* **00:35-00:37**: "It is also important to maintain personal hygiene..." - The student fails to properly convey the rising and falling tones on 'important' and 'personal', instead using a flat intonation.
* **00:38-00:40**: "...by taking a shower every day..." - The student lacks the rising tone on 'shower' and the falling tone on 'every' present in the expert's delivery.
* **00:41-00:43**: "...and washing our hands before every meal." - The student's intonation is flat, lacking the rising and falling tones on 'hands' and 'meal' used by the expert.

Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's. While the expert reads the passage at an average pace of approximately 175 words per minute, the student reads at a pace of approximately 100 words per minute. This is a significant difference in speed, indicating that the student needs further practice to improve their fluency and reading speed.
