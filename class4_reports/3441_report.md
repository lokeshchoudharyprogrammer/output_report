## Intonation Report

**Bucket:** Emergent

**Deviations from Expert's Intonation:**

* **00:01-00:03:** Student uses a near monotone delivery for "environment is the surrounding where we live in" instead of the expert's clear rising and falling tones.
* **00:04-00:06:** Student maintains a monotonous tone for "It is essential to maintain cleanliness by keeping our surroundings clean."
* **00:10-00:12:** "ensure that the environment remains clean" is spoken in a flat tone by the student.
* **00:13-00:15:** Student speaks "like throwing the garbage in the dustbin, instead of littering the streets" with a monotone, whereas the expert uses a clear upward inflection at the end of "streets."
* **00:16-00:17:** The student says "We should avoid using plastic bags" with a monotone instead of the expert's rising and falling intonation.
* **00:18-00:22:**  Student speaks "because it pollutes the environment as it cannot be recycled easily" with a consistent flat intonation.
* **00:25-00:26:**  "It is also important to maintain personal hygiene" is spoken without any noticeable rising and falling tones.
* **00:28-00:29:** Student says "by taking a shower every day and washing our hands before every meal" in a monotone.
* **00:30-00:33:**  "It is our responsibility to ensure cleanliness" lacks the characteristic rise and fall of the expert's delivery.
* **00:34-00:37:**  "because an unclean environment becomes a prominent reason for various diseases like dengue, malaria, etc." is spoken in a monotone.
* **00:38-00:41:**  Student's intonation remains flat for "like dengue, malaria, etc.".

**Conclusion:** 

The student demonstrates a limited understanding of proper intonation patterns, exhibiting clear rising and falling tones in less than 50% of instances. This categorizes the student's performance as **Emergent**.

## Reading Speed Report
**Bucket: Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's.  The student takes almost twice as long to read the same passage as the expert. 

**Specific Measurements:**

* **Expert's Time:** 41 seconds
* **Student's Time:** 1 minute 57 seconds 

**Notable Deviations:**

* The student struggles with pronunciation, taking long pauses and multiple attempts to pronounce words.
* The student tends to read slowly and hesitantly, often emphasizing syllables that are not typically stressed. 
* The student repeats words and phrases, which significantly slows down the reading speed.
* The student inserts unnecessary pauses and fillers, such as "uhm" and "um."

**Overall Evaluation:**

The student's reading speed falls within the **Emergent** category. The student's performance suggests a need for further development in reading fluency and pronunciation skills.  Practice with the specific vocabulary in the passage, as well as targeted exercises on pronunciation and rhythm, could significantly improve reading speed and comprehension.
