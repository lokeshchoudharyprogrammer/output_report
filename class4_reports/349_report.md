## Intonation Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's intonation deviates from the expert's in a significant number of instances, resulting in an overall performance that can be categorized as **Emergent**. The student displays difficulty in consistently utilizing rising and falling tones effectively, particularly in longer sentences.

**Specific Deviations:**

* **00:00 - 00:02:** The student uses a near-monotone delivery, lacking the clear rising and falling tones present in the expert's rendition. 
* **00:03 - 00:06:** While the student attempts to incorporate rising and falling tones, they are not consistently executed with the same clarity and precision as the expert. For example, the word "essential" should have a rising tone, but the student delivers it with a near-monotone. 
* **00:09 - 00:12:** The student struggles to maintain a steady rising and falling tone structure, especially during the phrase "that the environment remains clean."
* **00:13 - 00:15:** The student's intonation pattern is inconsistent, failing to mirror the expert's use of rising and falling tones in this part of the sentence.
* **00:17 - 00:20:** The student again employs near-monotone delivery, lacking the clear rising and falling tones present in the expert's rendition.
* **00:21 - 00:23:** The student's intonation is not as dynamic as the expert's, with the phrase "as it cannot be recycled easily" lacking a clear rising and falling pattern.
* **00:24 - 00:27:** The student maintains a near-monotone throughout this section, losing the clear intonation pattern present in the expert's delivery. 
* **00:28 - 00:31:** The student's intonation is not as nuanced as the expert's, with the sentence lacking the same clarity and precision in the use of rising and falling tones.
* **00:32 - 00:35:** The student uses a near-monotone delivery for the phrase "It is our responsibility to ensure cleanliness."

Reading Speed Report
Bucket: Emergent
The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's. The expert read the passage at an average pace of approximately 170 words per minute, while the student read at an average pace of approximately 100 words per minute. This represents a significant difference in speed, indicating the student's reading speed needs improvement. 

Specifically, the student struggles with:

* **Pace:**  The student's pace is inconsistent throughout the reading, often pausing for extended periods, causing a noticeable delay in their reading flow.
* **Fluency:** There is a lack of smooth transitions between words, creating a choppy delivery and hindering comprehension. 
* **Pronunciation:** The student mispronounces several words, like "hygiene" and "environment", which adds to the overall slowness of the reading.

The student's reading speed is considered emergent and requires significant practice and support to reach a proficient level.
