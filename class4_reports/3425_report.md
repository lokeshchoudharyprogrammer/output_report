Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Transitional**

The student's reading speed is moderately slower than the expert's. The student reads at an average of 1.7 words per second, while the expert reads at an average of 2.2 words per second. This difference in speed is consistent throughout the reading, indicating a consistent pace for the student. 

Notable deviations include the student's tendency to pause slightly longer at certain punctuation marks, particularly commas and periods, resulting in a slightly slower overall pace. There are also instances where the student takes a longer pause to process and pronounce certain words, such as "environment" and "hygiene". This suggests that the student may need more practice with pronunciation and fluency. 

Overall, while the student demonstrates a good understanding of the text and reads with clear pronunciation, their reading speed is moderately slower than the expert. Continued practice and exposure to various reading materials will help them improve their reading fluency and achieve a pace closer to the expert's.
