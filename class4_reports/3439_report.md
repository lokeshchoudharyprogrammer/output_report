Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's. The expert reads at an average pace of approximately 150 words per minute, while the student reads at an average pace of approximately 80 words per minute. This indicates a substantial difference in reading fluency.  The student's slower pace may be attributed to several factors, such as unfamiliarity with the text, difficulty decoding words, or lack of practice.  Further analysis of the student's performance would be required to pinpoint the specific areas for improvement.
