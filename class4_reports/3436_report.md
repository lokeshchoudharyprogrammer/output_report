The student exhibits more than 4 pauses longer than 1 second per minute of speech. This places them in the **Emergent** category. The student's fluency skills could benefit from a greater focus on reducing unnecessary pauses and improving rhythm and pacing.  
Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's. The student takes approximately 2 minutes to read the passage, while the expert reads it in 41 seconds. This indicates a substantial difference in reading pace.

Here are some specific observations:

* The student's reading speed is generally slower, with frequent pauses and hesitations. This is evident in the prolonged pauses between words and phrases.
* The student's pronunciation is also less clear and fluent, contributing to the slower pace.
* In addition to the slower speed, the student's reading exhibits several mispronounced words and a noticeable lack of expression and natural intonation. 
* The student struggles with several words, such as "environment", "cleanliness", and "recycling", which adds further to the overall slower pace.

Overall, the student's performance demonstrates a significant need for improvement in reading speed and fluency. This requires targeted practice to develop the necessary skills for effortless and engaging reading.
