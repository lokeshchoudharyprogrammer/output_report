## Intonation Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's intonation is generally unclear and inconsistent, deviating significantly from the expert's rendition.  Here are some specific examples:

* **00:01-00:03**: The student's pronunciation of "environment" and "surrounding" lacks the expected rising and falling tones, sounding monotone. The expert clearly differentiates these words with distinct intonation patterns.
* **00:04-00:05**: The student struggles with the intonation of "essential" and "maintain", failing to deliver the rising and falling tones present in the expert's recording. 
* **00:08-00:10**: The student's pronunciation of "there are many ways" and "which we can ensure" lacks the rising and falling tones, sounding monotonous. The expert clearly differentiates these words with distinct intonation patterns.
* **00:14-00:17**: The student's pronunciation of "instead of littering" and "We should avoid using" lacks the expected rising and falling tones, sounding monotone. The expert clearly differentiates these words with distinct intonation patterns.
* **00:22-00:24**: The student's pronunciation of "cannot be recycled" lacks the expected rising and falling tones, sounding monotone. The expert clearly differentiates these words with distinct intonation patterns.
* **00:27-00:32**: The student's pronunciation of "personal hygiene", "taking a shower", and "every meal" lacks the expected rising and falling tones, sounding monotone. The expert clearly differentiates these words with distinct intonation patterns.
* **00:36-00:42**: The student's pronunciation of "becomes a prominent" and "various diseases" lacks the expected rising and falling tones, sounding monotone. The expert clearly differentiates these words with distinct intonation patterns.

The above examples are a representative sample of the student's performance.  Overall, the student struggles to effectively utilize rising and falling tones in their speech, demonstrating a clear need for improvement in this area. 
Reading Speed Report
Bucket: Emergent

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's. The expert reads at a pace of approximately 130 words per minute, while the student reads at a pace of approximately 75 words per minute. This discrepancy can be attributed to several factors, including:

* **Pronouncing each syllable:** The student pronounces each syllable separately, which slows down the reading process. For instance, in the phrase "environment," the expert reads it as one word, while the student reads it as "en-vi-ron-ment," thus taking more time.
* **Unnecessary pauses:** The student takes frequent and prolonged pauses throughout the reading, particularly between sentences and phrases, which further hinders the reading speed.
* **Hesitation and repetition:** The student hesitates on certain words, often repeating them or taking a longer time to pronounce them. This behavior, while understandable, also contributes to the slower pace.

The significant deviation in reading speed highlights the need for the student to focus on improving their fluency and speed. This can be achieved by practicing reading aloud regularly, focusing on proper phrasing and intonation, and minimizing unnecessary pauses.
