## Intonation Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

**Deviations from Expert's Intonation:**

The student's intonation deviates significantly from the expert's, particularly in the following areas:

**1. Rising and Falling Tones:**

* The student uses a generally flat intonation throughout the passage, with minimal rising and falling tones. 
* The expert uses clear rising and falling tones to emphasize key words and phrases, creating a more dynamic and engaging delivery. For example:
    * **Expert:** "A smartphone is a gadget that combines the essential functions of a phone." (Clear rising tone on "smartphone" and "gadget," falling tone on "functions")
    * **Student:** "A smartphone is a gadget that combines the essential functions of a phone." (Flat intonation with minimal variation)

**2. Emphasis and Pause Placement:**

* The student often fails to emphasize key words and phrases, resulting in a less impactful and clear delivery.
* The expert strategically places pauses to create emphasis and improve clarity. For example:
    * **Expert:** "Smartphones have faster connectivity than other phone models. The process is not hampered by the distance or the different time zones." (Clear pauses after "models" and "zones" to emphasize the points)
    * **Student:** "Smartphones have faster connectivity than other phone models the process is not hampered by the distance or the different time zones." (Minimal pauses, making it harder to understand the intended emphasis)

**3. Pronunciation:**

* While the student's pronunciation is generally understandable, there are instances of mispronounced words, particularly with the "th" sound. For example:
    * **Expert:** "The process is not hampered by the distance."
    * **Student:** "The process is not a hampered by the distance." (Mispronunciation of "hampered")

**Specific Examples and Measurements:**

* The student maintains a relatively flat intonation throughout the passage, with a limited use of rising and falling tones. This can be observed in most instances, particularly in phrases like "essential functions" (0:04 - 0:06), "computer system" (0:11 - 0:12), "wireless earbuds" (1:03 - 1:04), and "travel related events" (1:32 - 1:34).
* The student often struggles with the placement of pauses, making it harder to follow the intended emphasis and meaning of the passage. This is noticeable in phrases like "The process is not hampered by the distance" (0:40 - 0:42), "Smartphones have faster connectivity" (0:34 - 0:37), and "It includes a joystick" (1:02 - 1:03).
* The student's pronunciation of words like "hampered" (0:40 - 0:41), "other phone models" (0:37 - 0:38), and "storage" (0:59 - 1:00) is not always clear and accurate.

**Overall:**

The student's intonation needs significant improvement. The lack of clear rising and falling tones and the inconsistent use of pauses make the delivery less engaging and harder to follow.  While the student's pronunciation is generally understandable, there are some instances of mispronounced words that require attention.

Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's.  The student takes around 2.14 minutes to read the passage, while the expert takes 1.21 minutes. This difference is significant, suggesting the student needs further practice to achieve a reading speed closer to the expert's pace.

Notable deviations include:

* **Hesitations and pauses:** The student frequently hesitates and pauses throughout the reading, breaking the flow and slowing down the pace.
* **Repetitions:** The student repeats words and phrases, further contributing to the slower reading speed.
* **Mispronunciation:** The student mispronounces certain words, indicating a lack of fluency and potentially hindering reading comprehension. 

These deviations collectively result in a much slower reading speed compared to the expert. The student would benefit from targeted practice to improve fluency, pronunciation, and reading speed.
