Reading Speed Report
Bucket: Transitional
```

The student's reading speed is moderately lower than the expert's. While the student maintains a consistent pace throughout the reading, they tend to read at a slower rate than the expert. This difference in pace is noticeable, particularly in the student's pronunciation of longer words and phrases. 

For instance, the student takes a slightly longer pause after each word, resulting in a slightly slower overall reading speed. Additionally, the student's pronunciation of some words, like "integrated" and "features," is slightly slower, contributing to the overall slower pace. 

While the student's reading is understandable and clear, their speed could be improved to match the expert's pace by focusing on maintaining a faster pace and improving their pronunciation of specific words.
