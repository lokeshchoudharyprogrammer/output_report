## Intonation Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's intonation frequently deviates from the expert's, showcasing a lack of consistent rising and falling tones. 

**Specific instances of deviation:**

* **0:00 - 0:03:** The student's intonation is flat throughout this section, lacking the clear rising and falling tones present in the expert's rendition.
* **0:05 - 0:07:** The student doesn't effectively capture the falling tone at the end of "system", leading to an overall flat delivery in the sentence.
* **0:12 - 0:13:** Instead of a rising tone at the beginning of "connectivity", the student's voice drops, causing the phrase to sound less natural. 
* **0:16 - 0:17:** The student's intonation is again flat in this section, missing the emphasis on "purchased" and "variety" that the expert clearly highlights. 
* **0:20 - 0:21:** The student delivers "features" with a slightly rising tone, deviating from the expert's falling tone.
* **0:23 - 0:24:** The student's intonation lacks the strong rising and falling tones present in the expert's delivery, particularly missing the emphasis on "models" at the end of the sentence.
* **0:27 - 0:28:** The student's intonation is flat throughout this section, missing the emphasis on "zones" that the expert effectively uses.
* **0:36 - 0:37:**  The student's intonation is flat in this section, failing to capture the rising and falling tones in the expert's pronunciation of "calls" and "chats".
* **0:41 - 0:42:** The student uses a flat tone for "etc", deviating from the expert's falling tone.
* **0:50 - 0:51:** The student lacks the rising tone on "world" and the falling tone on "connected" that the expert utilizes for emphasis. 
* **0:52 - 0:53:** The student misses the rising tone on "benefits" and the falling tone on "smartphone" that the expert uses to emphasize the phrase.
* **0:58 - 0:59:** The student misses the rising tone on "capacity" that the expert employs.
* **1:03 - 1:04:** The student fails to capture the clear rising and falling tones present in the expert's delivery of "tests" and "classes".
* **1:06 - 1:07:** The student doesn't effectively capture the falling tone on "back" that the expert uses to emphasize the phrase.
* **1:11 - 1:12:** The student's intonation is flat in this section, missing the emphasis on "distraction" and "addiction".
* **1:14 - 1:15:** The student misses the rising tone on "any" and the falling tone on "resource" present in the expert's delivery.
* **1:16 - 1:17:** The student's intonation is flat in this section, missing the falling tone on "phone" that the expert utilizes.
* **1:18 - 1:19:** The student's intonation is flat in this section, missing the falling tone on "outcomes" that the expert effectively uses.
* **1:20 - 1:21:** The student fails to capture the rising and falling tones present in the expert's delivery of "benefit" and "become".

The student's intonation is consistently flat or lacks clear rising and falling tones in most of the instances listed above. This indicates that they are still developing their understanding and implementation of intonation patterns.

00:00 - The student starts with a long pause, making it difficult to understand the beginning of the speech.
00:01 - The student takes a short pause here, it is not too long but it might be due to them taking a breath, so it might be unnecessary.

The student's performance is categorised as emergent. There are more than 3 pauses longer than 1 second per minute of speech, indicating a significant need for improvement in fluency skills. The student needs to focus on slowing down their reading pace, taking more controlled breaths, and practicing the text beforehand.
Reading Speed Report
Bucket: Emergent
The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's. The student's recording is 2:15 minutes long, while the expert's recording is 1:20 minutes long. This indicates a substantial discrepancy in reading speed. The student may benefit from targeted practice to improve their reading fluency and pace.
