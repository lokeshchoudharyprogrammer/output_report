Intonation Report
Bucket: Emergent
The student's intonation deviates from the expert's in a significant number of instances. Here are some notable examples:

* **00:01:** The expert uses a rising intonation on "gadget," while the student uses a falling intonation. This is a deviation from the natural rhythm of the sentence.
* **00:03:** The expert's intonation rises on "phone" and falls on "that," while the student's intonation remains largely flat. This weakens the impact of the sentence.
* **00:07:** The expert's intonation rises on "playing" and falls on "role," creating a strong emphasis on the key action. The student's intonation, however, stays relatively flat, reducing the impact of the phrase.
* **00:11:** The expert uses a falling intonation on "access," followed by a rising intonation on "computer," effectively highlighting these key elements. The student's intonation, however, is flat throughout the phrase, resulting in a less dynamic delivery.
* **00:14:** The expert's intonation rises on "etc." to signal the continuation of a list. The student's intonation, however, falls on "etc.," which makes the sentence sound incomplete.
* **00:16:** The expert's intonation rises on "used" and falls on "can," creating a natural flow. The student's intonation remains largely flat throughout the phrase, leading to a monotonous delivery.
* **00:19:** The expert's intonation rises on "rates" and falls on "depending," emphasizing the transition to the next point. The student's intonation, however, is flat throughout the phrase, reducing the impact of the transition.
* **00:23:** The expert uses a rising intonation on "connectivity," followed by a falling intonation on "other," creating a natural flow. The student's intonation remains largely flat throughout the phrase, making the delivery less engaging.
* **00:27:** The expert's intonation rises on "or" and falls on "time," emphasizing the contrast between the two elements. The student's intonation, however, remains flat throughout the phrase, failing to highlight the contrast effectively.
* **00:32:** The expert's intonation rises on "of" and falls on "special," highlighting the importance of the capabilities. The student's intonation remains flat throughout the phrase, reducing the impact of the sentence.
* **00:39:** The expert uses a rising intonation on "screens" and a falling intonation on "emailing," creating a smooth transition. The student's intonation remains largely flat throughout the phrase, failing to create an effective transition.
* **00:42:** The expert's intonation rises on "includes" and falls on "joystick," creating a strong emphasis on the beginning of the list. The student's intonation remains flat throughout the phrase, reducing the impact of the introduction.
* **00:49:** The expert's intonation rises on "revolution" and falls on "world," emphasizing the significant change. The student's intonation remains flat throughout the phrase, failing to highlight the impact of the revolution.
* **01:03:** The expert uses a rising intonation on "tests" and a falling intonation on "attend," creating a clear flow between the two actions. The student's intonation remains largely flat throughout the phrase, failing to create a natural transition.
* **01:09:** The expert uses a rising intonation on "vision" and a falling intonation on "decreased," highlighting the contrast between the two elements. The student's intonation remains flat throughout the phrase, failing to highlight the contrast effectively.
* **01:15:** The expert's intonation rises on "resource" and falls on "smartphone," emphasizing the transition to the next point. The student's intonation, however, remains flat throughout the phrase, resulting in a less dynamic delivery.
* **01:17:** The expert's intonation rises on "responsibly" and falls on "to," highlighting the importance of responsible usage. The student's intonation, however, remains flat throughout the phrase, reducing the impact of the sentence.

The student's performance can be categorized as Emergent. There are several instances of clear rising and falling tones, but they are less frequent than 60% of the total. While the student demonstrates some understanding of intonation, they need to pay more attention to using rising and falling tones to create rhythm, emphasis, and flow in their speech.
