The student's intonation often falls flat, lacking the natural rise and fall that makes speech engaging and clear. This results in a monotone delivery, which can make the speech sound robotic and less impactful. The student also struggles to maintain the correct intonation patterns within sentences, often using falling tones where rising tones are required. The student's performance is categorized as **Emergent** as the clear rising and falling tones are less than 60% of the instances.

The student's fluency is **Emergent** as the student has taken more than 3 pauses longer than 1 second per minute of speech. Reading Speed Report
Bucket: Emergent

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's. The student takes an average of 0.77 seconds per word, while the expert takes an average of 0.52 seconds per word. This difference in reading speed is substantial, indicating the student needs to work on improving their fluency. 

Some notable deviations include:
- The student tends to pause more frequently, often at the end of sentences or even mid-sentence. This breaks the flow of reading and makes the reading sound choppy. 
- The student's pronunciation is not always accurate, especially with some longer words. This can make it difficult for the listener to understand the text.
- The student often hesitates before reading certain words, indicating they are unsure of their pronunciation or meaning.

Overall, the student's reading speed is significantly lower than the expert's, and there are several areas for improvement, including fluency, pronunciation, and confidence.
