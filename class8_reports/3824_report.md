Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Transitional**

The student's reading speed is moderately slower than the expert's. While the student maintains a consistent pace throughout the reading, they read approximately 10% slower than the expert. This difference is noticeable in the overall duration of the reading, with the student taking longer to complete the passage.  

Notable Deviations:

* **Word Pronunciation:** The student demonstrates a slightly slower pace in the pronunciation of certain words, like "integrated" and "capability." The pronunciation is correct but slightly elongated. 

* **Phrasing:** The student utilizes slightly shorter phrases than the expert, which results in a slower overall reading speed. 

* **Emphasis:** The student maintains a similar level of emphasis to the expert but demonstrates a less pronounced emphasis on certain key phrases and words. This may contribute to the perception of a slightly slower reading pace.
