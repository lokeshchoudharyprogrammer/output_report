## Intonation Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

**Deviations from Expert's Intonation:**
The student's intonation consistently deviates from the expert's, displaying a lack of clear rising and falling tones throughout the recording. The student primarily uses a monotonous, flat intonation, particularly in longer sentences. 

**Specific Examples and Measurements:**

* **0:01 - 0:04:** The expert uses a rising tone in "A smartphone is a gadget that combines the essential functions of a phone" followed by a falling tone in "that has an integrated computer system". The student uses a monotonous tone throughout, lacking the emphasis and variation of the expert.
* **0:10 - 0:15:**  The expert's intonation rises and falls in "Internet access, computer connectivity, icons, etc. Smartphones are widely used...". The student utilizes a flat tone with minimal variation in their delivery.
* **0:24 - 0:27:** The expert employs a clear rising tone in "The process is not hampered by the distance or the different time zones." The student's delivery maintains a flat tone, missing the emphasis and rhythm of the expert.
* **0:34 - 0:40:**  The expert uses various rising and falling tones in "which include new icon games, calls, chats, video calls, cameras, touch screens, emailing, storage, etc.", highlighting the different functionalities of smartphones. The student delivers the passage with minimal intonation, failing to adequately emphasize the various features.
* **0:49 - 0:52:** The expert emphasizes "It is a revolution for the world that would keep everyone connected". The student's rendition uses a flat tone, lacking the emphasis and variation evident in the expert's delivery.

**Conclusion:** The student's intonation throughout the recording demonstrates significant room for improvement. They need to focus on developing clear rising and falling tones to enhance their delivery and comprehension.
