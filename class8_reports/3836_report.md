**Overall, the student demonstrates inconsistent use of rising and falling tones throughout the recording.  While there are some instances where the student accurately utilizes the intonational pattern, these are not frequent enough to reach the "Transitional" level of performance.

Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's. While the expert read the text at a pace of approximately 150 words per minute, the student's pace was around 75 words per minute. 

The student exhibited noticeable hesitations and pauses throughout the reading, particularly when encountering longer words and phrases. This frequent pausing and slow reading rate significantly impacted the overall flow and comprehension of the text. Additionally, the student struggled with pronunciation, mispronouncing several words, which further slowed down the reading pace.
