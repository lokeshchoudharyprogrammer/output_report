**Analysis:**

The student demonstrates very few clear rising or falling tones throughout the recording. In over 90% of instances, the intonation is flat or deviates from the expert's pattern. The lack of clear intonation makes the speech sound monotonous and lacks the natural flow and emphasis found in the expert's rendition. This performance is therefore categorized as **Emergent**.
