Reading Speed Report
Bucket: Emergent

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's. The student takes approximately 2.3 seconds per word, while the expert takes 1.3 seconds per word. This indicates a considerable pace difference between the student and the expert. 

The student also frequently pauses between words, affecting the overall fluency and comprehension of the passage. The slow pace is noticeable from the first few words and persists throughout the entire reading. This could be attributed to difficulties in pronunciation, decoding, or lack of practice.  

The student's reading performance falls within the "Emergent" category due to the significant speed difference and frequent pauses, highlighting a need for further practice and guidance to improve their reading fluency and speed.
