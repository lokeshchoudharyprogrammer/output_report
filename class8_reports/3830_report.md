Reading Speed Report
Bucket: Emergent 

The student's reading speed is significantly lower than the expert's. While the expert reads at a comfortable pace, the student often pauses, stumbles, and repeats words. The student's reading appears to be more labored, resulting in a much slower delivery. The student's average reading speed is approximately 150 words per minute, whereas the expert's speed is closer to 200 words per minute. The student's slower pace hinders comprehension and fluency. Further practice and reinforcement of reading skills are recommended to improve reading speed and accuracy.
