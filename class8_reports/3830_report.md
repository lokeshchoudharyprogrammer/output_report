Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly lower than the expert's. The expert reads at an average rate of approximately 160 words per minute, while the student reads at a rate of approximately 100 words per minute. 

There are several notable deviations in the student's reading speed:
* The student often pauses for extended periods, particularly before and after complex words and phrases.
* The student tends to read in a choppy and uneven manner, lacking a smooth flow.
* The student mispronounces several words throughout the passage, indicating a lack of familiarity with the vocabulary. 
* The student's pronunciation and articulation are unclear at times, making it difficult to understand the spoken words.

These factors collectively contribute to the student's reading speed being significantly slower than the expert's.
