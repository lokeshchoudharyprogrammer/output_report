The student’s performance is categorized as Emergent. The student’s fluency needs further improvement. There are too many pauses longer than 1 second per minute of speech, creating a halting and unnatural delivery. They need to focus on reducing the duration of pauses between words and practice delivering the text in a more natural and smooth manner. Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Transitional**

The student's reading speed is moderately lower than the expert's. The student reads at a rate of approximately 120 words per minute, while the expert reads at around 150 words per minute. This difference in pace is consistent throughout the recording.  

The student's reading is generally fluent, but their slower pace occasionally causes them to stumble over words or phrases, particularly when encountering longer words or complex sentence structures. They also tend to emphasize certain words more heavily than the expert, which can affect the natural flow of the reading.
