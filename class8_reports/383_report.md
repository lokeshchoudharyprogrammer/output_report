This leads to a slightly less fluent and natural delivery. With practice, the student can strive to reduce these pauses and deliver the text with a smoother and more engaging flow.
Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly lower than the expert's. The student reads at an average of 107 words per minute, while the expert reads at an average of 155 words per minute. This difference is a 31% deviation, indicating a significant gap in pace. 

Several factors contribute to this difference:

* **Hesitation and pauses:** The student exhibits frequent hesitations and pauses throughout the reading, indicating difficulty with word recognition and fluency.
* **Slowed down pronunciation:** The student pronounces words at a slower pace than the expert, further contributing to the overall slower reading speed. 
* **Mispronunciations:** The student mispronounces several words, which also leads to a slower reading pace and negatively impacts comprehension.

These observations indicate that the student needs additional support to improve their reading speed and fluency. Addressing the underlying difficulties with word recognition and pronunciation is crucial for the student's progress.
