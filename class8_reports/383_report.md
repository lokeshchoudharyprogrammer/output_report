Reading Speed Report
Bucket: Transitional
```

The student's reading speed is moderately slower than the expert's. The student reads at an average of 140 words per minute, while the expert reads at an average of 165 words per minute. The student's reading speed is slightly slower in the initial portion of the text, but the pace picks up towards the middle. This suggests that the student may be gaining confidence as they progress through the passage. 

However, the student does exhibit some noticeable hesitations and pauses throughout the reading, which contribute to the overall slower pace. The student also uses a slightly different pronunciation for some words, such as "smartphone" and "features," which may contribute to the perceived difference in reading speed. 

Overall, the student's performance can be categorized as transitional. While the speed is not significantly slower than the expert's, there is room for improvement in terms of fluency and maintaining a consistent pace.
