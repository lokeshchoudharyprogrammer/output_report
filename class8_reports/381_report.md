Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's.  The expert reads the entire text in approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds, while the student takes nearly 1 minute and 50 seconds.  This means the student's reading pace is about 15% slower than the expert's. 

Notable deviations include:

* **Word-by-word reading:**  The student reads each word individually, rather than grouping words into phrases for smoother delivery. This contributes to the slower pace.
* **Pauses and Hesitations:** The student makes frequent pauses and hesitations throughout the reading, particularly between sentences and clauses.
* **Pronunciation:**  While the student's pronunciation is generally understandable, there are some instances where they mispronounce words, which adds to the overall reading time.
