Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Emergent**

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's.  For instance, the expert reads the sentence "A smartphone is a gadget that combines the essential functions of a phone that has an integrated computer system with mobility playing a key role." in 8 seconds, while the student takes 13 seconds.
