## Intonation Report

Bucket: **Transitional**

The student's intonation deviates from the expert's in several instances. While they demonstrate clear rising and falling tones in a majority of instances, there are several areas where they struggle to replicate the expert's intonation patterns. 

Here are some instances of deviation:

* **0:06-0:08:** The student's intonation on "integrated computer system" is flat and lacks the clear rising and falling tones present in the expert's rendition. The expert uses a rising tone on "integrated" and "computer" and a falling tone on "system," whereas the student maintains a flat tone throughout.
* **0:09-0:11:**  Similar to the previous example, the student fails to differentiate between "features" and "include" with appropriate rising and falling tones. They maintain a flat tone on both words, whereas the expert uses a falling tone on "features" and a rising tone on "include."
* **0:14-0:15:** The student fails to properly emphasize "smartphones" with a falling tone, instead maintaining a flat intonation throughout the phrase "smartphones are widely used." The expert uses a rising tone on "smartphones" followed by a falling tone on "widely used." 
* **0:24-0:25:** The student misses the opportunity to emphasize "models" with a clear falling tone, opting instead for a flat tone. The expert's rendition features a falling tone on "models," effectively highlighting the phrase.
* **0:32-0:34:** The student utilizes a flat tone on "capabilities," whereas the expert uses a rising tone followed by a falling tone, creating a clear emphasis. This lack of intonation on "capabilities" hinders the student's overall clarity.
* **0:48-0:51:** The student struggles to maintain a steady rising tone on "revolution," opting instead for a flat tone, making the phrase less impactful. The expert uses a rising tone on "revolution" and a falling tone on "world."
* **1:03-1:04:** The student uses a flat tone on "attend classes," whereas the expert uses a falling tone on "attend" and a rising tone on "classes," effectively emphasizing the phrase.

While the student demonstrates a grasp of basic intonation patterns, their performance demonstrates a need for further practice and refinement.

Reading Speed Report
Bucket: **Transitional**

The student's reading speed is moderately higher than the expert's. The student reads at an average pace of 172 words per minute, while the expert reads at an average pace of 148 words per minute. This difference in speed is noticeable, especially in sections where the expert pauses for emphasis or takes a slower pace to articulate complex words. The student tends to read more rapidly through these sections, sometimes sacrificing clarity for speed. 

While the student demonstrates a good grasp of the text and maintains a consistent flow, the faster pace occasionally leads to minor mispronunciations or slightly rushed delivery. Overall, the student's performance showcases a solid reading foundation, but could benefit from focusing on pacing and maintaining a more nuanced delivery, mirroring the expert's approach.
