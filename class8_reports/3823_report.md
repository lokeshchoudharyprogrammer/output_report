```

The student's intonation deviates from the expert's rendition in a significant number of instances. Their performance is categorized as **Emergent** because the rising and falling tones are not consistently present.  The student uses mostly flat tones throughout the recording, resulting in a monotonous delivery.  They also mispronounces some words and misplaces some intonation.

Reading Speed Report
Bucket: Emergent
```

The student's reading speed is significantly slower than the expert's. The student frequently pauses and takes longer to pronounce words, particularly longer and more complex words. This leads to a noticeably slower pace compared to the expert's smooth and fluent delivery. 

For example:

* The expert reads "smartphone" in about 0.6 seconds, while the student takes approximately 1 second.
* The expert reads "capabilities" in about 0.9 seconds, while the student takes about 1.5 seconds.

These discrepancies in reading speed create a significant difference in the overall pace and rhythm of the reading. The student's performance is categorized as "Emergent" because the disparity in speed is substantial and consistently noticeable throughout the reading.
